Maccarone VS Code Extension
===========================

See [the **core Maccarone documentation**](https://github.com/bsilverthorn/maccarone) first! That will explain what this tool does and how it works.

This README documents the VS Code extension _only_.

## Setup

Install the (free) extension from [the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maccarone.maccarone).

Make sure you have Python **3.10+** installed and configured as the default interpreter in VS Code.

You'll need an OpenAI API key **with GPT-4 access**. Set it in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or configure it in VS Code under the Maccarone extension settings.
